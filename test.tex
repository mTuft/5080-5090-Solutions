All math should go into a math environment. $X+1=Y$ There are two types of math enviornments. Single dollar sign and double dollar sign. $$X+1=Y$$ Another thing to keep in mind, there are no spaces. $$hello everyone how are you?$ If you want to start a new paragraph, use a double backslash\\
This should be a new paragraph.\\
Now to go through some common commands used in 5080. All commands begin with a backslash.\\
To create a fraction $\frac{1}{X}$\\
To create a subscript: $F_{x,y}$\\
To integrate with bounds $\int_{x}^{1}f(x,y)dx$\\
To specify a distribution: $Y \sim DE(\theta ,0)$
To write a branched function: $$f(x:\theta, \eta)= \begin{cases} \frac{1}{2\theta} e^{x-\theta} \qquad 0>x \\
0 \qquad otherwise \end{cases}$$\\

One other useful thing is an equation array.
\begin{eqnarray*}
f(x) &=& x+3y\\
&=& x+3(x+2)\\
&=& x+3x+6\\
&=& 4x+6
\end{eqnarray*}
